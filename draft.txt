As a follow up to our telephone conversation, here are the details of my
investor's financial position that I was attempting to describe to you. 
Over the last six months, Mac and I approached many investors, and recently 
one of our investors agreed to invest their surplus turnover with us.

Currently, our client's money is held by the Amerian bank Wells Fargo.
They have also sent us a letter of credit which can be transferred on-demand. 
Wells Fargo has assigned to Barclays Bank, London to transfer their money on their behalf. 

Our client is one of the biggest footwear exporters in Bangladesh.  
Mac and I have recommended our investor to invest their money in the UK rather than in Bangladesh. We envisaged to open two bank accounts
one is our investment account under our company name (Business Business LTD newly registered), and another one is client/Escrow account. We have
already applied for a business bank account in Starling Bank.

We want to operate our company as a financial services company. Through that channel can redistribute our client's money into different asset classes.
As you may understand from the above discussion, this is our first attempt to operate this type of asset management company.
 We are very much that we need to comply with the FCA regulation, that is why I have contacted you. 

We would like some advice regarding the most efficient way which to invest our client's money, whilst adhering to relevant investment laws and legislations.
